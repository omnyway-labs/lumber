#+title: lumber - another Clojure logging library

Lumber is yet another really minimal logging library for Clojure. It
aimed to be compatible with Timbre, but lost interest after a while.

Don't use it unless you are absolutely desperate for a "do the
absolute minimum" logging library. You've been warned.

* Usage

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
  (require '[lumber.log :as log])

  (log/info {:id 1 :message "hello"})
  ;; 2050-03-05 20:54:33 INFO user:84 {:id 1, :message \"hello\"}

  ;; thread locally set :serializer to JSON serializer - generally not a
  ;; good idea to mix different serializers in the same log stream
  (log/with-config {:serializer #'kit.util.core/write-json}
    (log/info {:id 1 :message "hello"}))
  ;; 2050-03-05 20:56:38 INFO user:84 {\"id\":1,\"message\":\"hello\"}

  ;; globally set the serializer
  (log/set-default-config {:serializer #'kit.util.core/write-json})

  (log/info {:id 1 :message "hello"})
  ;; 2050-03-05 20:56:38 INFO user:84 {\"id\":1,\"message\":\"hello\"}
