#+title: lumber - another Clojure logging library

Lumber is yet another really minimal logging library for Clojure. It
aimed to be compatible with Timbre, but lost interest after a while.

Don't use it unless you are absolutely desperate for a "do the
absolute minimum" logging library. You've been warned.
